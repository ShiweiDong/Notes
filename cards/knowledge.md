# What is knowledge?

Knowledge is not something that you just know. In fact, what a lot of people
think is knowledge was simply information.

For information to be a knowledge, it must survive two very important premise:

1.  Help with your decision process. This includes the assumption that you need
    to be able to recall the "knowledge" when you make decisions. If it's just
    hindsight, the knowledge is still not yours.
2.  Contribute to your long term well-being.
